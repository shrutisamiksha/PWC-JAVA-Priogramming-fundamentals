Sarah got confused to calculate volume of cylinder and cuboid. Write a Java application to help Sarah to do this.

Requirement: Calculate the volume.

Component Specification:  VolumeCalculator

Component Name                 Type(Class)               Methods                                                               Responsibilities

Calculate the Volume of        VolumeCalculator       public double calculateVolume(double radius,double height)             This method calculates the volume of the cylinder and returns 
the Cylinder                                                                                                                                 the calculated volume of the cylinder   
                                                                                                                              Formula
                                                                                                                              Volume of the cylinder =3.14*radius*radius*height
 

              

Calculate the Volume          VolumeCalculator        public double calculateVolume(int length,int breadth,int height)       This method calculates the volume of the cuboid and returns the 
                                                                                                                              calculated volume of the cuboid       
of the Cuboid                                                                                                                 Formula
                                                                                                                              Volume of the cuboid =length*breadth*height








 



























Note: The class and methods should be declared as public and all the attributes should be declared as private. 

Example

Length = 3

Breadth = 2

Height = 1

Formula

Volume of the Cuboid = length*breadth*height

Volume of the Cuboid = 3*2*1= 6.00.

 

In the UserInterface class, write the main method to test the application.

 Note:

The output format should be in two decimal places. Use "System.out.printf("%.2f", percentage);" for 2 digits after the decimal points.
In the Sample Input / Output provided, the highlighted text in bold corresponds to the input given by the user, and the rest of the text represents the output.
Ensure to follow the object-oriented specifications provided in the question description.
Ensure to provide the names for classes, attributes, and methods as specified in the question description.
Adhere to the code template, if provided.
